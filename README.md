# Ningbo University Subjective Point Cloud Quality Assessment (CPCD2.0) Database
This is an introduction of color point cloud dataset with G-PCC/V-PCC coding and Gaussian noise distortions (CPCD2.0).
# Data description:
There are 10 reference point clouds, including ‘soldier’, ‘redandblack’, ‘queen’, ‘loot’, ‘longdress’, ‘andrew’, ‘david’, ‘ricardo’, ‘sarah’ and ‘phil’.  
(‘Egyptian_mask’ point cloud is used as a demo session to familiarize each subject with the goal of subjective test and distortion types in our subjective experiment).  
Each reference point cloud was processed by the latest PC coding schemes (i.e., MPEG G-PCC and V-PCC) and Gaussian noise, corresponding to 36 distorted point clouds. So A total 360 distorted point clouds in CPCD2.0 database.  
Distorted PCs were evaluated by people through a subjective test with a five-grade quality scale. MOS value for all database is also provided.
